Cleanup old links to osv-team

Update documentation

Done
----

Some SVG drawings for some ISO standards

Library documentation generation from the PJSON file
  Generating one .rst per PJSON library file

Sphinx documentation of **party**, of the PJSON file format and of the template format

Move generated script files tests from 'tests' to a function that can be used by library creators to test the generated scripts are ok

Migrate issues from standard-cad-parts

Units management : list in units section of JSON

Automate library.json generation based on the contents of the input file (contains {{ generators }}, aliases, __alias__

STEP, STL and HTML generation should be possible (but not automatic)

Technical drawings integration. Help the user understand where a dimension of the standard is used.
  Autogeneration of the technical drawings from the geometry generators (templated scripts) has been abandoned (overly complicated)
  Technical drawings are made with Inkskape and integrated in the PJSON file
  Technical drawing SVGs can be extracted from the PJSON files after having been integrated
  Technical drawings are used in the autogenerated documentation of a parts library

Skeleton generation from name : generate folder + 'generators' subfolder + library_template.py

Option to strictly enforce a nomenclature defined in a template file (carried over to the final PJSON)

Separation of code (party repository) and data (standard-cad-parts repository)

Library checks
  Metadata is the same for each part (the list of fields is also returned)
  Check units are coherent (every field linked to a unit)

Todo
----

'include' library creation mechanism + impact on the autocreation

library JSON names must be different, yet with a constant (e.g. *_library.json)
  -> impact on global creation functions?

Improve screw geometry generator

create an HTML file that allows querying the library?
  Should we be able to query on the name of alias parameters (e.g. __alias__M1) -> yes -> rename to 'M1' instead of deleting
  The field name should be in the 'infos/dimensionless' section of units

Materials

Auto-computed geometric signature based on SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

Checks for duplicate part ids

Desktop PJSON library browsing UI
Web PJSON library browsing UI

Handling of profile (2D) section libraries (i.e. standard sections + length = part)
